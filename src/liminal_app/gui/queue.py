"""The Fetcher view (the queue) and each plugin's fetching status (its page in the Plugins view).

The user, 2026-10-31: "the fetcher will then just show the queue of all resources being downloaded
like symbols", "the plugin status will be available in the plugins:: plugin page". The Fetcher lists
the fetch queue (storage/queue.py) across plugins: every resource waiting, being fetched, held,
failed or done, by plugin, kind and state; a row left running by a process that is gone says so.
A plugin's page shows its own: whether it is fetching (and what), waiting, paused or stopped, its
queue, its feeds' requests against their caps, their limits and runs, and its lines of the log.
Read from the queue, the ledgers, the kills, the run locks and the log: no requests.
