"""The MongoDB server under a keeper host (mongo.py, `liminal host mongo`): a process attaches to the
keeper when its documents live in MongoDB, the keeper starts the server for the first client and
shuts it down cleanly once the last one is gone (the user, 2026-11-01: "attached software like
duckdb or what ever should be controlled by the plugin"; no processes when the app is not in use).
Nothing here starts a process: the host, the keeper and the server are stand-ins."""
